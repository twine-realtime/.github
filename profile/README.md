## Overview

Twine is a scalable and open-source RaaS (Real-time as a Service), designed to reliably abstract away the complexity of real-time communication for modern web applications.

Twine automates the deployment of real-time architecture by utilizing developer-owned AWS cloud services. This architecture provides a load-tested pub/sub mechanism that developers access through a secure API, and default connection state recovery in the case of client-service disruption. Additionally, it persists all published data as a backup, while providing developers with complete control over their Twine service and all of the data that travels through it.

## Using Twine

- Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://github.com/twine-realtime/deploy) for deploying a Twine service on your AWS account.
- Refer to the documentation of the [client](https://github.com/twine-realtime/client-library) and [server](https://github.com/twine-realtime/server-library) libraries to connect your web application to your Twine service.
